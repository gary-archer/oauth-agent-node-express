# Cloud Native Token Handler

This repository is a copy of the following implementations, to provide a cookie layer for SPAs:

- [OAuth Agent](https://github.com/curityio/cloud-native-oauth-security-examples/tree/main/chapter-13-browser-based-apps/backend-for-frontend/oauth-agent)
- [OAuth Proxy](https://github.com/curityio/cloud-native-oauth-security-examples/tree/main/resources/apigateway/curity-oauth-proxy)

The only addition to logic is extra REST operations to rewrite cookies to simulate expiry of access and refresh tokens.
