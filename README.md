# A Node.js OAuth Agent for SPAs

The OAuth agent is an API that issues cookies for Single Page Applications.\
See the original Curity solution for documentation and concepts:

- [Curity master version](https://github.com/curityio/oauth-agent-node-express)

## This Fork

The only difference in this fork is that I added operations for simulating expiry.\
This enables my example SPA to test that expiry is handled reliably.
