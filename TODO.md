# TODO

## Testing

userinfo route:
- to configure in API gateway

tests:
- without cookies I will not get a 401
- change to handle claims inside parent object
- no longer has API tests due to lack of local convenience

## SPA

SPA:
- change pageLoadResponse to include claims inside parent object

## Serverless

- Equivalent logic
- Test locally
- Redeploy and test remotely
- Keep API tests since it is practical
